# Investigate a Bikeshare Database

This program provides data on users and bicycle rentals in three cities in the USA: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The user can choose which city to display data for, and can also select a specific month and day to filter the results.

## Tools Used

The following tools were used to create this program:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

## Usage

To use this program, you will need to have three `.csv` files filled with bikeshare data for the cities of Chicago, New York City, and Washington. These files can be downloaded from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). Once you have the files, place them in the same directory as the `bikeshare.py` file.

To run the program, open a GitBash shell and type `ipython bikeshare.py`. Then follow the prompts on the screen.
